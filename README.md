# The Kerbal Space Program Community Tech Tree

This is a community-sourced tech tree designed to support as many mods as possible and extend the KSP technology experience without affecting the way stock is laid out.

This mod is not a rebalance or a restructure, and does not affect the positions of items in the tree. It is the responsibility of the modder to add their parts to the appropriate part of the tree. Check out the [For Modders](https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/CommunityTechTree/blob/master/ForModders.md) file for more information.

Please see the KSP [Forums thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90530-131-community-tech-tree-july-26th-new-techs/) for more information.

## Contributions

I welcome contributions and improvements to the repository. New tech nodes and changes to the existing structure however must go through a consultation process on the KSP [Forums thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90530-131-community-tech-tree-july-26th-new-techs/), so please post there first.

Please target any pull requests to the `dev` branch.

## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

This mod is only a tech tree! It requires an appropriate version of ModuleManager to function.
